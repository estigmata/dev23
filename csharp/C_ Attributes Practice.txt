C# Attributes Practice
----------------------

1. Create a custom attribute that can be applied only to fields.
	a. It must contain a constructor receiving a string as input parameter.
	b. It must contain a public property.
	c. It must contain a public method that retrieves a concatenation of the parameter value received in the constructor + the value of the public property.

2. Create a custom enumerator
	a. It must contain at least 3 fields.
	b. Each field must use the created "custom attribute".

3. Create an extension method for any enum type
	a. It must contain a method that is going to use reflection in order to retrieve the value of the public method created inside the "custom attribute".
